			Daily Dolly is developed by **meh.6784** and the source is available on
			[GitHub](https://github.com/meh/dolly).

			General
			=======
			Daily Dolly is designed to help you keep track of everything time-gated
			on a daily basis that isn't somehow provided by the standard GW2 UI, this
			includes dungeons, fractals, crafting and world bosses.

			To minimize the window double click the icon on the top left, keep in
			mind this icon will change depending on the section you're viewing but
			its functionality won't change.

			To move the window around click and drag the icon mentioned above.

			To access a section, click on the title next to the icon and select the
			section from the dropdown menu.

			To access the options panel click on the gear icon on the top
			right.

			Dungeons
			========
			Keep track of the dungeon paths you've done, including earnings in gold,
			silver and tokens.

			Clicking on a path will mark it as done, and update the earnings at the
			bottom.

			Fractals
			========
			Keep track of the fractal levels you've done, including earnings in gold,
			silver, fractal relics and pristine fractal relics.
			
			Clicking on a level will mark it as done, and update the earnings at the
			bottom.

			Crafting
			========
			Keep track of the various time-gated craftables, this includes ascended
			mats, items for Mawdrey and miscellanea.

			Clicking on a crafting item will mark it as done.

			World Bosses
			============
			Keep track of the various world bosses in the world, including the
			off-schedule ones.

			Clicking on the waypoint icon will copy the closest waypoint to the
			clipboard.

			Clicking on the world boss name will mark it as done.

			A green timer represents hours and minutes remaining before the
			activation window begins, when one minute is left it will start blinking.

			During the event window the timer represents minutes and seconds passed
			since its beginning, it will be orange during warmup, red during its
			duration, and it will start blinking when it ended.

			*The warmup and duration times are approximations.*

			Options
			=======
			There are various options to adapt Daily Dolly to your liking.

			- `Interface Size` should be the same you configured Guild Wars 2 with.
			- `In-Game Only` allows you to show the interface either only while in
			  game or even on your desktop.
			- `Language` allows you to change the language from a list of GW2
			  supported languages.
